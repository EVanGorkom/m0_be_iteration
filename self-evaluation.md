# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
*Using the 'each' method can be helpful for searching a very large variable or database for all values that you are looking for. Effectively acting as a fine tooth comb for your variables.*

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
*I feel like I should get some more practice with iterations and look at different methods and problems to help me identify when I need to use an each loop and when I should use a different tool instead.*

- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
*I met the challenge head on and just did it. I didn't really need too much of a refresher for the information since I've been practicing it already.*
